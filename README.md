# CPU-Simulator_python
Process scheduling algorithm simulator for SJF(Shortest Job First) and FCFS(First Come First Serve) algorithms.

This algorithm simulates a CPU that executes processes with random arrival times, 
randomly generated (with poisson formula) process lengths.
CPU has 2 queues and each queue has its own scheduling algorithm:
-SJF
-FCFS
